In its seventh year, the National Student Electronic Music Event solicits works for its annual conference on February 8-9, 2019 at the University of Virginia in Charlottesville, VA. 

N_SEME is an inclusive artistic and academic environment, incorporating DIY approaches to music-making, experimenting with instrument design, and participating in many forms of intermedia collaboration. We consider many forms of composition to be electronic music, including, but not limited to:

* electronic improvisation
* multimedia art

* tape/fixed media
* live electronics, analog or digital
* video
* DIY instrument performance
* audiovisual environments
* interactive electronic systems
* sound installations
* acoustic instruments and electronics
* dance and electronics
* multi-channel works

Composers currently enrolled as graduate or undergraduate students in a college or university are invited to submit up to two works across the following categories:

1. Music (day concert and late night)
2. Papers
3. Sound Installations

### Music Submissions
* Electroacoustic music for fixed media, with up to eight channels of audio.
* Works combining musical instruments or voice with electronics.
* Works for electronic instruments.
* Video and multimedia works.

Works in progress will be considered if a substantial part of the work is complete. The accepted works cannot exceed the duration indicated at the time of submission, and the final version cannot be substantially different from the versions submitted.

For the selection process, multichannel works must be submitted as stereo mixes.

Works involving instrumentalists are welcome, but the submitter must provide their own performer(s). Pieces should not exceed 12 minutes.
