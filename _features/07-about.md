The National Student Electronic Music Event (N_SEME) was created by and for students as a forum for peers to share ideas, collaborate, and expand the boundaries of the electronic music field. This year features Aaron Dilloway, a celebrated experimental/noise artist, whose music includes eight-track tape loops, vocal improvisation through contact microphones, found sounds, and field recordings. In addition to a concert and talk by Aaron, the festival includes concerts, papers, sound art installations, a DIY audio workshop, and a radio broadcast. N_SEME @ UVA is an inclusive artistic and academic environment, incorporating electroacoustic composition with or without instruments, DIY approaches to music-making, experimenting with instrument design, and participating in many forms of intermedia collaboration.
