## NSEME 2019 webpage

This is the webpage for NSEME 2019 at the University of Virginia.

To edit me, you need to install Git and Jekyll. These are all terminal commands.

0. Install `git`, if you don't have it. [Give yourself an hour.](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)
1. `gem install bundler` (bundles all the Ruby dependencies)
2. `gem install jekyll` (jekyll runs the server)
3. `git clone https://github.com/thely/nseme2019.git` (downloads this repo)
4. `bundle exec jekyll serve --watch` (starts the server, watches your files for changes, updates when it sees changes on anything except `_config.yml`)

Go to `localhost:4000/nseme2019` to view the page.
